# Advance Programming Concepts (Udemy) — Practice Source Code

This repository contains my **practice source code**, experiments, and small notes while taking the Udemy course:

https://www.udemy.com/course/advance-programming-concepts/

## Goals

- Recreate examples from the course to ensure I understand the concepts
- Solve exercises and extend them with extra scenarios
- Keep a clean, searchable history of my learning progress
- Experiment freely (refactors, alternative approaches, edge cases)

### Folder meanings

- **`section-XX/lesson-YY/`**: code tied to specific sections/lectures
- **`playground/`**: experiments, refactors, spikes, and “what-if” tests
- **`notes/`**: short notes, summaries, or references (optional)

## Disclaimer

This repository contains **my own practice implementations** created while learning.  
It does **not** contain or redistribute paid course videos or proprietary course materials.
